# Create flows for popular email scenarios

Here are some of the top scenarios in which you can use Power Automate to manage your email:

1. Send an email from your account.

1. Send an email from a distribution list (DL) or shared mailbox.

1. Send an email with voting options.

1. Build an *approval* process and notify colleagues via email.

1. Send *reminder* email to approver.

1. Send a daily digest email with a summary table.

## Send email from your account

To send email from your account, use the [Send an email (V2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/office365/#send-an-email-(v2)) action. 

You can send the email to one or more recipients. You can use the rich text editor to **bold text**, add some color, and format the email, similar to the way you do in Outlook. You can add static text or values from previous actions using dynamic content. You can use the **send as** option to send email as someone else, or on behalf of someone else. You can find all email you send in your **Sent items** folder in Outlook. To use this option, you’ll need the permissions in Outlook to send on another person's behalf.

For example, if you have a flow that sends you an email once your item is approved, you can add the link of the approved item as an attachment.

## Send email with voting options

<!--todo add a link to actionable email-->
Use the **Send email with options** action to send an email with voting options using *actionable* email. Use the user options field to provide voting options.

The recipients receive an email similar to this:

In your flow, you must capture that voted response and save it somewhere. You could email yourself, save it to Excel, post to Teams etc. Don’t forget to save it, otherwise you won’t know what people chose.

## Send an email from a distribution list (DL) or shared mailbox

Use the [Send an email from a shared mailbox (V2) ](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/office365/#send-an-email-from-a-shared-mailbox-(v2)) action and specify the shared mailbox address to send email from a shared mailbox. 

The distribution list (DL) admin must first give you [permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/send-email-as-distribution-list?view=o365-worldwide) to the shared mailbox/ When you use this action, email appears in your shared mailbox’s sent folder because you’re sending it from that account directly.

## Build an approval process and send notifications via email 

You can use Power Automate to [build an approval process that notifies users via email](https://o365hq.com/blog/build-an-approval-process-with-power-automate).

## Send reminder email to approvers

You can also send [reminder emails for approval requests](https://flow.microsoft.com/blog/approval-reminders-using-parallel-branches).

## Send a daily digest email with a table

Here are three ways you can send a daily digest email with a table:

1. Use the [Data Operation – Select ](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/data-operations#use-the-select-action) action to create a table with the column names and data you'd like to see in the email.
You can further format the data using expressions. In following example, the flow gets calendar events between a time frame, converts the time zones, and then creates a table with the events.

   ![A screenshot displays an example flow with a table](./media/email/table.png)

1. Add the [Create HTML Table](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/data-operations#use-the-create-html-table-action) action and then add the output from select action to the HTML action.

1. Add the [Send an email (V2](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/office365/#send-an-email-(v2)) action, add the output from an HTML table into the body of the email, and then set the **Is HTML** property to true.

   >[!TIP]
   >Remember to select **Is Html** in the email action.
