# Set up Power Automate Desktop

Before you can use your device to create desktop flows, you'll need to ensure it meets the requirements outlined here.

> [!TIP]
> Before you create a desktop flow, check the [list of connectors](https://flow.microsoft.com/connectors/) to see if the application you want to automate already has a connector. If it does, consider creating a cloud flow instead of a desktop flow. You might also build your [own connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/custom-connectors/).

## Prerequisites

- A work or school account to sign into your Windows device with administrator privileges and Power Automate.

- System requirements:

   - A device that runs Windows 10 Home, Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Enterprise, Windows Server 2016, or Windows Server 2019. ARM devices are not supported.
      
      - Minimum hardware
         - Storage: 1GB
	      - RAM: 2GB
     - Recommended hardware
        - Storage: 2GB
	     - RAM: 4GB
     - .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later 
     
> [!TIP]
> If your device runs Windows 10 Home, you can use Power Automate Desktop to create your desktop flows and monitor them on [Power Automate](https://powerautomate.com). You can't trigger desktop flows to run from the cloud on Windows 10 Home devices. Other types of desktop flows (Windows recorder V1 and Selenium IDE) are not supported.

![Installation options image](../media/desktop-flows-setup/installer-checkboxes.png)

### Set data collection options

During installation, you can change the default settings if you do not want to send usage data to Microsoft. To do so, uncheck **Allow Microsoft to collect usage data to improve Power Automate**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Sharing usage data to Microsoft, will help the support department to solve a Power Automate Desktop issue.

## Set the display language for Power Automate Desktop

The language used in the Power Automate Desktop is the display language selected on your Windows OS. Get more details on how to [manage display language settings in Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-display-language-settings-in-windows-10-219f28b0-9881-cd4c-75ca-dba919c52321).

## Install the Power Automate browser extension 

After the installation completes, you will need to install and enable the extension for Power Automate Desktop. This extension will allow you to record and run web actions in your desktop flows.

![Installation success image](../media/desktop-flows-setup/screen.png)

Select one of the links displayed in the installer. For example, if you want to record your web automations on Microsoft Edge, select the **Microsoft Edge** link.

   The store for your browser opens directly to the public page for the extension.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you already install the Power Automate extension in the past, you don't need to reinstall it

#### Microsoft Edge: 
- [Install Edge extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2151411): select **Get**, and then select **Add extension** when prompted. 
- If you see the message: *This extension has been turned off in Microsoft Edge*, at the top of the page, select **Turn on extension**.

#### Google Chrome: 
- [Install Chrome extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2150929): select **Add to Chrome**, and then select **Enable extension** when prompted. 
- If you see the message: *This item has been disabled in Chrome* on top of the page, select **Enable this item**.

#### Mozilla Firefox:
- [Install Firefox extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2151511): select **Add to Firefox**, and then select **Add** when prompted. 


> [!TIP]
> If you are not able to activate the extension(s) in your browser, you must use [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/) (version 80 or later) or Google Chrome or Firefox. Other browsers are not suppoted. 

## Install the on-premises data gateway to run your desktop flows from the cloud

You will need the gateway to trigger your desktop from an [event, schedule, or button flow.](..\flow-types.md) on a remote device.

>[!TIP]
>The gateway isn't required if you only want to create, edit, and test your flows on your device.

[Install the on-premises data gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install), if you need it.


>[!IMPORTANT]
>You must install the on-premises gateway on each device from which you automate desktop flows.

>When you install the gateway, it defaults to the region that Power Automate uses.


## Setup desktop flows connections and machine credentials

### Install the gateway with PowerShell Cmdlets

You will need the on-premises data gateway to trigger your desktop flows from a cloud flow.

You can use [PowerShell Cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/gateway/overview?view=datagateway-ps) to install, configure, and manage your gateway.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To use PowerShell cmdlets, you will need to run them from PowerShell 7.0.0 or higher in an elevated session.

## Troubleshoot missing gateway

You might not find the gateway in the list while creating the connection for the following reasons:

- The gateway may be installed in a different region than your Power Automate region. To resolve this issue, uninstall the gateway from the device, and then reinstall it, selecting [the correct Power Automate region](../regions-overview.md#region-mappings-for-power-automate-and-gateways).
- The gateway was deleted by its owner.

## Install Windows recorder (v1) extension (optional)

The Windows recorder (v1) is another option to record and playback your desktop automations. We recommand you to use Power Automate Desktop since this is the latest RPA solution.

Follow these steps to install Windows recorder (v1) extension:

1. Install the extension on Microsoft Edge and/or Google Chrome from the store (Firefox is not supported for Windows recorder (v1))

#### Microsoft Edge: 
- [Install Edge extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2151412): select **Get**, and then select **Add extension** when prompted.

#### Google Chrome: 
- [Install Chrome extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2150930): select **Add to Chrome**, and then select **Enable extension** when prompted. 


## Install Selenium IDE to automate Web applications with desktop flows (optional)

The Selenium IDE is an open source tool that lets you record and playback human interactions on Websites.

With desktop flows, you can run Selenium IDE scripts from Power Automate and keep them stored securely (with appropriate IT governance) in Dataverse.

Follow these steps to install Selenium IDE:

1. Make sure you already installed and enabled Windows recorder (v1) extension (see previous section)

1. [Download and install](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2107665) the Selenium IDE for [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/) (version 80 or later) or Google Chrome.

1. On Microsoft Edge (version 80 or later), select **Allow extensions from other stores**, and then select **Add to Chrome**.

## Known issues and limitations

1. Only work or school account users with Dataverse database provisioned in their default environment can create Power Automate Desktop flows. Power Automate Desktop flows will be stored in the default environment with the Dataverse database. If the Dataverse database doesn't exist in the default environment, the user will not be able to create Power Automate Desktop flows and be prompted to create a database. There will be no connectivity of Power Automate Desktop flows with cloud flows.  

    - After creating the Dataverse in the Power platform admin center, intermittently user might get prompted to create the database again. In this scenario, restart Power Automate Desktop (exit from the system tray icon).

    - Microsoft Dataverse provisioning in the default environment from Power Automate Desktop to create a flow will be supported in the upcoming release.  

1. If the customer already installed PAD and has paid attended RPA license or trial license and wants to try Free MSA, they have to download the latest PAD version with March release to sign-in using their Microsoft Account. Otherwise, they see the below error.  

      ![The prompted sign-in dialog with the respective error.](media\known-issues\pad-sign-in.png)

1. Microsoft Account and Work account without a paid license are not supported in Sovereign clouds. GCC, GCCH, China sovereign clouds need paid license to sign-in to Power Automate and paid attended RPA license to use Power Automate Desktop.    

1. Windows Recorder v1 desktop flows does not support
    -   Multiple monitors.
    -   Double click, mouse hover, touch/pen input.
    -   Interactions on Windows (File explorer, startup menu, task bar, etc.)

1. Selenium desktop flows do not support
    -   Right click.
    -   User session information (for example: cookies) will not be reused during
        playback. You will have to edit the script to embed sign in information when required by websites.

You'll find feature-specific limitations included in the documentation for each feature.
