# Release notes

>[!NOTE]
>Release plans are now tracked [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/release-plans/).

## Top questions
1. My flow failed. How do I fix it?
   
   1. Identify the failure. Start by going to the notifications icon at the top of the web portal, or selecting the **Activity** tab in the mobile app. You should see your flow there, and you can select it.
   2. You are now looking at the flow details. Find the step with the red exclamation icon, and you should see the error message for your flow there.
   3. Depending on the error message, you should be able to **Edit** the flow and fix it. [Read more about how to fix common flow failures](fix-flow-failures.md).
2. How do I use an advanced condition or an expression?
   
   * Read about [adding conditions](add-condition.md).
   * If you want multiple cases in a flow, select **Add condition** from inside of an existing condition.
   * Create an advanced expression by referencing [a function in Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/logic/definition-language).
3. How does licensing work with Office 365?
   
   * If you're an Office 365 user, you get full access through the Power Automate for Office 365 plan. For more information, see the [pricing plans for Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/pricing/) .
   * If you're an administrator, see information about [licensing for Power Automate](organization-q-and-a.md), including with Office 365.

## Known issues
1. SharePoint lists on My Sites and that aren't of type *Custom List* aren't supported. To work around this issue, create a custom list on a standard SharePoint site.
2. File triggers won't fire for files being added inside of nested folders inside the folder you select.
