# Frequently asked questions

## Audience and strategy
### What is Power Automate?
Power Automate is a cloud-based service that makes it practical and simple for line-of-business users to build workflows that automate time-consuming business tasks and processes across applications and services.

### Who is the intended audience for Power Automate?
Power Automate has two distinct audiences:

* Line-of-business “Citizen Integrators” in enterprise organizations who partner with IT to move responsibility for business solutions closer to the business itself.
* IT decision makers who want to empower line-of-business partners to create their own solutions so IT professionals and integration specialists can focus their expertise on more advanced integration tools, such as Azure Logic Apps.

### How do Power Automate and Logic Apps relate to each other?
Power Automate provides features that help line-of-business users create automated workflows. Logic Apps is an Azure service that provides the same great features of Power Automate, plus features such as integration with Azure Resource Manager and the Azure Portal, PowerShell and xPlat CLI, Visual Studio, and additional connectors. [Learn more about Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/logic/).

### How does Power Automate fit in Microsoft’s overall business application platform strategy?
Power Automate is part of a powerful and adaptable business application platform that includes Power Apps, Microsoft Dataverse, Dynamics 365, and Office 365. This platform allows our customers, our partners, and our ISV partners to create purpose-built solutions for their own companies, their industry, for functional roles or even for specific geographies. Line-of-business users, who understand their business needs best, can now easily analyze, compose, and streamline data and processes. Professional developers can easily extend the automation, analytics and apps line-of-business to leverage Azure services like Functions, App Service, and Logic Apps. API connectors, gateways, and Dataverse make it possible to get more value out of services or data already in use, either in the cloud or on-premises.
