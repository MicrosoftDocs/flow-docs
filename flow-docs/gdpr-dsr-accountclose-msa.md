# Responding to GDPR Data Subject Account Close Requests for Microsoft Flow - Microsoft Accounts (MSA)

The “right to erasure” by the removal of personal data is a key protection in the GDPR. Removing personal data includes removing all personal data except audit log information. When a user decides to close their Microsoft Account, the user's underlying data will also be deleted.

The following table shows resources containing personal data that will be automatically deleted when a Microsoft Account is closed.

|Resources containing personal data|
|------|
|Product and service activity|
|Run history|
|Flows|
|Activity Feed|
|User details|
|Connections|

**Website access:** The following website provides support to close your Microsoft Account.
* [Microsoft Account Close Portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898)
