# Automate using images



On the right-hand side pane, select the **Images** tab.

Select **Capture image**, and a crosshair with a magnifying glass will appear. Then, capture the image by clicking and dragging, while using the magnifying glass for pixel precision.

Additionally, select the arrow on the **Capture image** button to capture images on a timer. Select the number of seconds and enter a new value to adjust the timer.

After capturing an image, specify a name for it in the dialog box and select **OK** to add it to the flow.

![image name](\media\images\image-name.png)

Select **Add a new folder** and specify a name to create a folder in Images. Sort images into folders by capturing images while the specific folder is open. Navigate back by clicking on **Home**.

To rename or delete images or folders, right-click on an item and select the appropriate function. Select the image thumbnail to open and view it.

### Known issues and limitations
